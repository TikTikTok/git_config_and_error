1.   $ git init (it initializes the git into your local master branch--> master branch is default created while  git initialization )
2.   $ git add . (adds all the files to local master branch)
3.   $ git commit -m "commit message" (commit to local master branch )
4.   $ git remote add origin <repository url till .git> (this command connects the local master branch with the remote master branch )
5.   $ git config --global credential.helper store ( this commands makes git details available as global. Ex. if you don't fire this command, git would ask you the git username and password everytime you push code to remote branch. )
6.   $ git push origin master ( pushes the code to remote the branch)
7.   $ git status ( it shows the status of the git files -->  if some files are in red colour, you need to add them. if some files are in green, you need to commit them. if some files are in while colour, you need to push them to the remote branch.)
8.   $ git log (it shows the all the commits done.)
9.   $ git branch <branchname> (it creates the branch... you may want to work on your branch, not impacting or making changes to the master)
10.  $ git branch -b <branch-name> (it creates the branch and switches to the crated branch together)
11.  $ git checkout <branch-name> (it allows to switch the branches)
12.  $ git merge <branch-name>  (it merges the two branches. you could be into any of the branch and select any other branch to merge the code as required.)
