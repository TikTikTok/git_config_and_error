1.   $ git init (it initializes the git into your local master branch--> master branch is default created while  git initialization )

3.   $ git commit -m "commit message" (commit to local master branch )
4.   $ git remote add origin <repository url till .git> (this command connects the local master branch with the remote master branch )
5.   $ git remote (it shows the where is your remote branch is. for pushing code to remote it should always be 'origin'.)
6.   $ git config --global credential.helper store ( this commands makes git details available as global. Ex. if you don't fire this command, git would ask you the git username and password everytime you push code to remote branch. )

11.  $ git branch -b <branch-name> (it creates the branch and switches to the crated branch together)
12.  $ git checkout <branch-name> (it allows to switch the branches)
13.  $ git merge <branch-name>  (it merges the two branches. you could be into any of the branch and select any other branch to merge the code as required.)
14.  $ git branch (it shows the branch belongs to a repository).
15.  $ git config -l (it lists out the your repositorie's global data)
